# Security Policy (Stub)

## Reporting
If you discover a vulnerability, open a private issue or email the maintainer (to be added) instead of posting publicly.

## Secrets
Never commit API keys. Provide `.env.example` updates when adding new variables.

## Data Privacy
Currently only local storage. When adding remote APIs, ensure no PII is stored unencrypted.
